    ===================================================
    It looks like spec_helper.rb has been loaded
    multiple times. Normalize the require to:

    require "spec/spec_helper"

    Things like File.join and File.expand_path will
    cause it to be loaded multiple times.

    Loaded this time from:

    #{e.backtrace.join("\n    ")}
    ===================================================
